## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
This is a command used to install the dependencies required for a project.\
When you run npm install, npm reads the project's package.json file and downloads and installs the necessary packages listed in it.\
This is typically one of the first commands you run when starting a new project or when sharing a project with other developers to ensure that all project dependencies are installed.


### `npm start`

This is a command used to start the application in development mode.\
When you run npm start, it usually launches a local development server and opens the application in your default web browser. In this mode, the application typically auto-reloads in response to code changes, making it convenient for development and debugging.\
The provided link in the example, http://localhost:3000, is the address of your local development server. You can access it in your web browser to view your application.
