# Getting Started with Create React Website

Project Summary:

This project is a full-stack web development endeavor with the goal of creating a user-friendly news sharing platform. Users are able to post news and evaluate content based on its appeal through voting. The project encompasses both front-end and back-end technologies, along with the implementation of various features.

**Key Highlights**:

1. **Front-End Proficiency**: In the realm of front-end development, the project prominently showcases the application of the React library. This includes the use of React Hooks such as useState and useEffect to craft interactive user interfaces. Through React, we have successfully realized dynamic user interfaces, enabling users to effortlessly post news and cast their votes.

2. **Back-End Data Management**: The project harnesses the Supabase technology stack to create and maintain databases and APIs. This ensures the reliable storage and secure retrieval of data, providing essential data support to the front end. Proficiency in back-end data management enables efficient storage and retrieval of news data, delivering a high-quality user experience.

3. **Rich Functionality**: The project encompasses a variety of functionalities, including the "voting functionality." Users can vote on news items, marking them as interesting, mind-blowing, or false, thereby enhancing user engagement and content evaluation. Additionally, data validation is implemented to ensure the accuracy and credibility of user-provided data, ultimately enhancing data quality and reliability.

**Conclusion**:

This full-stack web development project not only demonstrates adept application of front-end and back-end technologies but also underscores the professional skills required for implementing features and data validation in real-world projects. Through this project, we have successfully created a user-friendly news-sharing platform, offering an interactive and content-rich experience to users. The experience and skills gained from this project will undoubtedly find ample application in future full-stack development endeavors.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
This is a command used to install the dependencies required for a project.\
When you run npm install, npm reads the project's package.json file and downloads and installs the necessary packages listed in it.\
This is typically one of the first commands you run when starting a new project or when sharing a project with other developers to ensure that all project dependencies are installed.


### `npm start`

This is a command used to start the application in development mode.\
When you run npm start, it usually launches a local development server and opens the application in your default web browser. In this mode, the application typically auto-reloads in response to code changes, making it convenient for development and debugging.\
The provided link in the example, http://localhost:3000, is the address of your local development server. You can access it in your web browser to view your application.
